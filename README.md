# EECS484-PS4
This is used for tracking EECS 484 Homework 6
Code created by CXQ41@case.edu, the great and smart Frank Qian (Just kidding)...

## Example usage

If somehow you ended up here, you must be very bored or you are a student taking modern robot programming and you have no clue how to write the code. 

If you download the code and still can't figure out how to run it, go get some help from your TA or Dr. Newman.

## Running tests/demos

I guess I will just post what grade I get for this as a "demo" of if this works or not....
